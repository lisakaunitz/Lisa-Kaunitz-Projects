# Welcome to my Projects! 


## 199 Research 
Here you will find the research project I worked on with a UCLA's Statistics faculty member. 

Dataset: 

The Final_Sample_Data.Rmd is the rmd file with the cleaned data and the final dataset used - accidents.csv, along with a sample of the data - sampledata.csv

Final Report: 

199Report.pdf is the final pdf version of the report. The code used to create the report is added at the appendix of the report and can be used to reproduce the pdf. 
This also includes the codebook used in the final dataset. 

Final .Rmd File: 

199ResearchCode.Rmd is the file that was used to carry out all exploratory data and analysis. It was made for reproducibility of the research.
