# Welcome to my Projects! 


## 199 Research 
Exploratory data analysis on the causes of car accidents in the U.S. with the goal of creating insights that can be implemented in autonomous vehicles.

**199ResearchCode.Rmd**: is the file that was used to carry out all the exploratory data and analysis. It was made for reproducibility of the research. 

**199report.pdf**: is the final pdf version of the report. The code used to create the report is added at the appendix of the report and can be used to reproduce the pdf. This also includes the codebook used in the final dataset. 

**199sampledata.csv**: is the csv file of a sample of the final dataset that was used. 

## Statistical Consulting Project
Myself and five other talented individuals worked with Dr. Ariana Anderson, Ph.D. (our client) to find: what are the significant risk factors that predispose a child to ASD behaviors? This project largely showcased my *Data Handling* skills, as my team and I wrote over a thousand lines of code to solely clean the original dataset and create new variables. We then ran a *Random Forest* to give us the best predictors and node purity for finding ASD risk factors. 
 
**Consulting_Presentation.pdf**: this is the final Presentation that we presented our client, Dr. Anderson. 

**Consulting_final_report.pdf**: this is the final Report that my team members and I came up with after thousands of code to clean the original dataset we were given. We were able to render our findings in one cohesive report and our client was pleased with our conclusions. 

## Consumer Behavior 
This was my first independent research project during my undergraduate career. It was created in the discipline of communications and was meant to be presented like so. I was able to create my own survey and post-hoc analysis on this observational study. 

**Consumer_Behavior_report.pdf**: this is the final report made for an audience in the Communications Studies discipline.
